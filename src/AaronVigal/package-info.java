/**
 * An application designed as a proof of concept to attack Millard Public Schools logins that are known to be brute forcible. 
 * The goal is to bring attention to the fact that our accounts are at risk and action should be taken to prevent this painstakingly easy attack. 
 * We have curated a list of usernames exported from Google Contacts and programatically generated a list of possible password combinations from the formula used to generate passwords for Millard's Students.
